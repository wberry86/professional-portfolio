      <h4>
        Hi, my name is Will Berry and I am currently looking for a career in web
        development. I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also
        familiar with utilizing Git Bash and the command line terminal in order
        to create repository's via GitHub in order to collaborate and work
        through the process of developing code. I received my technical skills
        while attending Vanderbilt Coding Boot-Camp and would be interested in
        helping companies set up websites via the use of HTML and CSS. I would
        also like to help debug and streamline code in a more efficient manner.
        My past academic history includes a Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies
        from Carson Newman University, with a focus on: Computer design,
        editing, an introduction to media law and ethics, media design,
        planning, story-boarding, video/audio editing, marketing and
        advertisement, creation of movie posters, editing and filming of
        trailers, creation of websites, and the design and implementation of
        company logos. Together with my technical and creative skills combined,
        I should prove to be a valuable asset to any company looking to hire new
        talent.
